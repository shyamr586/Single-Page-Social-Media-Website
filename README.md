# single-page-file-uploading-social-media-website

A website made with only one html file, two js files (client and server) which allows uploading of files with the help of databases.

Instructions:

(using portablenode):

1. Install portable node and put the application in a parent folder. server1.js is to be dragged into the main folder which has portable node.

2. Create a folder named 'main' inside the parent folder. Into that folder, add 'index.html', 'main.css', 'client1.js', 'mywebsite.sql'.

3. Create two other folders inside the 'main' folder named 'resources' and 'uploadtest'.

4. Add all .gif, .ttf, .mp3 and .png files into the new 'resources' folder.

5. Run using portable node using 'node server1.js' command.

The uploadtest file will be empty until a file is uploaded, which also updates the database. NOTE: Some libraries used are external and need to be installed.
